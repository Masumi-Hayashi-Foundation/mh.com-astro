    Japanese-American Internment Camps
  </h1>
  <p class="prose mb-8 sm: mx-6 mb-16">
    Dr. Masumi Hayashi (1945-2006) created the panoramic photo collage, which
    became her signature artistic format. and creative research that deals with
    the internment of Americans of Japanese ancestry during World War II. This
    project started with Hayashi's panoramic photo collages which show the
    remnants of sites of Japanese American Internment camps during World War II
    and were symbolic of an archeological and historical memory. Professor
    Hayashi interviewed camp survivors in different areas of the United States
    and Canada which became part of the artwork installation in galleries and
    museums. She collected photographs taken by these camp survivors when
    cameras were contraband. Ms. Hayashi project was a search for a collective
    memory, having been born in the camps, but having no memories of the camps.
    It was also a personal pilgrimage. These voices, photo collages, and
    snapshots have become a project that resonates today as we observe our
    history today.
